# Fake-News-Detector-using-NLP
So we used two datasets to for this model, one of which was the Fake. csv and other being true csv files containing true and fake news. We subsequently had to clean our dataset so that it could be properly used on our model. We removed the city names and reuters fields from our dataset since they were useless and caused overfitting.
